# Perl in a box!

This image contains perlbrew, cpanm, and the latest stable Perl at the time
of building.

As I type, the latest stable version is 5.18.2.

## Other Perls

If you're looking for pre-built images of other levels of Perl, check out
[RsrchBoy's Docker index][1] for more "trusted builds".

# Profit!

Enjoy.  Ideas / bugs / suggestions?  Feel free to
[submit issues or pull requests via github][2] :)

Please note **I do not expect to be gittip'ed or flattr'ed** for this work,
but it is rather a very pleasant surprise.  I largely create and release works
like this because I need them or I find it enjoyable; however, don't let that
stop you giving me money if you feel like it ;)
